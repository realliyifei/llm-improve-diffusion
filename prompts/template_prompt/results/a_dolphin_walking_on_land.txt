> Why "A dolphin walking on land" is counterintuitive? Explain.

The concept of a dolphin walking on land is counterintuitive because it goes against our expectation of how the animal should behave. Dolphins, as aquatic creatures, are not adapted to move on land and their bodies are not built for it. They are adapted to live in water and use their fins to swim and navigate. As such, the idea of a dolphin walking on land goes against our understanding of how the animal should move and behave.
