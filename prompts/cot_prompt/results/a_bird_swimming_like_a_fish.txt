Explain: This image is unusual because birds typically fly in the air and fish swim in water.
Convincing Details: The bird is able to use its wings to propel itself in the water, allowing it to swim like a fish. It trails behind a group of fish, which it follows and mimics their movements.
Visual Features: The bird is a bright, vibrant color, in contrast to the dull-colored fish. Its wings and feathers are slightly modified, allowing it to move gracefully through the water.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the bird's typical activities, such as flying, flying in the air, or soaring, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
