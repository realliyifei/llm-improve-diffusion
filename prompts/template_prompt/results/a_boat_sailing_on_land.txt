> Why "A boat sailing on land" is counterintuitive? Explain.

A boat sailing on land is counterintuitive because boats are designed to sail on water, not land. Boats rely on buoyancy to float, which requires a liquid medium such as water. On land, boats would be unable to move as they lack this buoyancy, and the lack of liquid medium would prevent them from being propelled forward.

A boat is surprisingly sailing on land, navigating a dried-up river, being towed by a truck on a flat, paved road, floating on an inflated pool in a desert landscape, powered by a sail skimming over a frozen lake, or pulled by a group of people on a grassy field.
