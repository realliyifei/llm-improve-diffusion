> Why "A turtle flying like a bird" is counterintuitive? Explain.

"A turtle flying like a bird" is counterintuitive because turtles and birds are two completely different species of animals, so it is difficult to imagine a turtle flying in the same manner as a bird. Turtles are adapted to live on land, while birds are adapted to fly in the air. Turtles have short, stubby legs and a hard, heavy shell that makes flying impossible. Birds, on the other hand, have light, hollow bones and wings that enable them to take flight.
