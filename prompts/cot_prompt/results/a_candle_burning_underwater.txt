Convincing Details: The candle is enchanted, allowing it to be lit underwater. The flame is contained in a bubble, protecting it from the water and enabling it to burn normally.
Visual Features: The candle is held by a mermaid, who is guiding it through the depths of the ocean. The flame is contained in a bubble, emitting a warm glow that is visible in the darkness of the deep.
Forbidden words: Any words related to fire should be avoided since the flame needs to be contained underwater.
