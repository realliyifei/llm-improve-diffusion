Given an unusual description that is anti-commonsense or counterintuitive, 
your task is to first give the explanation that why it is unusual, 
then add more visual details and contexts to make the image of this description more convincing.
In the last, summarize the above explanation and details into one long sentence, as a caption of a picture.

1. Description: A fish is walking on land
Explain: This image is unusual because fish do not have the ability to walk on land and typically live in water.
Convincing Details: The fish adapts its fins as legs that allow it to explore its surroundings. The fish walks in a city, which is more distinguishable than the area it usually lives in, i.e., water.
Visual Features: The fish is brightly colored and wears a small backpack, indicating it is on an adventure. The fin-adapted legs are flexible, allowing it to walk like a human.
Forbidden words: Since the fish usually live in water, to make the image less usual and more convincing, all water-related words should be avoided.
One-sentence description without forbidden words: A vibrant fish, equipped with fin-adapted legs and a backpack, walks in a beautiful city.

2. Description: A suit of armor is dancing ballet
Explain: This image is unusual because a suit of armor is typically heavy, inanimate, and not associated with the grace and elegance of ballet dancing.
Convincing Details: The suit of armor has been magically enchanted or mechanically modified to move with fluidity and precision, allowing it to perform ballet steps with ease. The dance takes place in a grand ballroom filled with surprised onlookers.
Visual Features: The suit of armor is polished to a high shine, reflecting the chandeliers above. The location is a ballroom specifically designed for ballet.
Forbidden words: Any words related to typical uses of a suit of armor, such as battles, knights, and war, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description without forbidden words: In a grand ballroom, a gleaming suit of armor gracefully performs ballet.

3. Description: Description: A cactus is ice-skating
Explain: This image is unusual because cacti are immobile plants and cannot participate in activities like ice-skating.
Convincing Details: The cactus is brought to life by a magical spell, allowing it to participate in winter activities.
Visual Features: The cactus wears a warm scarf and a pair of ice skates, gliding gracefully on a frozen pond with snowflakes gently falling in the background.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the desert are unnecessary since they are highly related to the cactus habitat but also contradict the ice.
One-sentence description: Under a magical spell, a cactus adorned with a cozy scarf and ice skates comes to life and skillfully glides across a picturesque frozen pond.

4. Description: A mountain is building a bridge
Explain: This image is unusual because a mountain does not possess motivation, tools, or a body to build a bridge.
Convincing Details: The mountain has a human-like face, suggesting that it is alive and driven by purpose. Equipped with hands, it wields a hammer to construct the bridge.
Visual Features: The mountain, with its human-like face and hands, is situated among other mountains. It uses a hammer to build a bridge that connects two mountains.
Forbidden words: Any words related to typical mountain characteristics or features, such as peaks, valleys, or rocks, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
