Explain: This image is unusual because boats typically sail on water and not on land.
Convincing Details: The boat is propelled by sails, just like on water, as it navigates its way through a desert.
Visual Features: The boat is a small wooden vessel with two sails, and is manned by a crew of sailors. The desert landscape is dry and barren, with little vegetation.
Forbidden words: Any water-related words should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description: Against a desolate desert backdrop, a courageous crew sails a small wooden vessel with two sails, in search of new horizons.
