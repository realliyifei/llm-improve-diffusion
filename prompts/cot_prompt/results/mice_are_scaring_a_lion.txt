Convincing Details: The mice are dressed in costumes and are equipped with magical items that make them appear larger and more intimidating. The lion is startled and taken aback by the sudden appearance of the mice.
Visual Features: The mice are wearing costumes of intimidating creatures and wielding wands that produce bright lights. The lion is cautiously looking around, unsure of what is happening.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the traditional roles of mice and lions, such as prey and predator, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
