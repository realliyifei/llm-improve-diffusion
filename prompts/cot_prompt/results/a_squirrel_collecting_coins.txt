Visual Features: The squirrel is standing on a park bench and looks at the coins with a wide smile, indicating its joy and satisfaction with what it has achieved.
Forbidden words: Any words related to typical squirrel activities, such as gathering nuts or jumping from tree to tree, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
