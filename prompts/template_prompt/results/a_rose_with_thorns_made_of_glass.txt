> Why "A rose with thorns made of glass" is counterintuitive? Explain.

"A rose with thorns made of glass" is counterintuitive because the thorns of a rose are typically sharp and rigid, making them an effective deterrent against predators and other potential threats. Glass, however, is fragile and easily broken, thus making it an ineffective defense. Additionally, glass is not a natural material and is not typically associated with roses, making the image of a glass-thorned rose even more counterintuitive.
