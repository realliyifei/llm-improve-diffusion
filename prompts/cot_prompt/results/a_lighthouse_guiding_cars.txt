Visual Features: The lighthouse is brightly lit and stands tall, surrounded by winding roads. The beam of light is visible from a great distance, helping drivers navigate even in the darkest of nights.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the sea, such as boats, ships, or water, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
