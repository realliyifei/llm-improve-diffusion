> Why "A bee with a propeller instead of wings" is counterintuitive? Explain.

A bee with a propeller instead of wings is counterintuitive because bees are adapted to fly using wings, not propellers. Propellers are an artificial invention that have no place in the natural world, and are completely incompatible with the physiology of a bee. Bees use their wings to generate lift, and the flapping and movement of the wings is necessary for flight. A propeller would not be able to provide enough lift to keep the bee airborne, and the bee would not have the necessary

1. The bee is attached to a miniature motorized propeller, which is mounted on its back.
2. The bee is wearing a small harness that holds the propeller in place.
3. The propeller is spinning at a rapid speed, creating a buzzing sound.
4. The bee is hovering in the air, propelled by the propeller instead of its wings.
5. The bee is surrounded by a halo of light created by the spinning propeller.
