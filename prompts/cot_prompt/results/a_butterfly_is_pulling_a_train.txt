Explain: This image is unusual because butterflies cannot exert enough force to make a train move.
Convincing Details: The butterfly has been enlarged by a magical spell, making it strong enough to pull the train. Its wings have also been modified to look like a locomotive's wheels, making it appear as if it is pulling the train with its wings.
Visual Features: The butterfly is bright and colorful, with its wings transformed into locomotive wheels. The train is composed of various carriages, representing the different aspects of life.
Forbidden words: Any words related to typical butterfly characteristics, such as flutter, short-lived, and fragile, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
