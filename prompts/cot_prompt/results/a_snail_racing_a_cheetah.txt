Explain: This image is unusual because a snail is generally much slower than a cheetah and therefore not expected to surpass one in a race.
Convincing Details: The snail is driven by determination and the will to win, and the cheetah is surprisingly slow due to a recent injury.
Visual Features: The cheetah limps slightly as it runs, while the snail moves quickly and steadily. They are racing in an open, grassy field with a few spectators lining the sides.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the snail's typical speed should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description: In an open grassy field, a determined snail and an injured cheetah race against each other, with a few onlookers observing the unexpected contest.
