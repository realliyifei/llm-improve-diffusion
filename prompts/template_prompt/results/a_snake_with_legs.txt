> Why "A snake with legs" is counterintuitive? Explain.

"A snake with legs" is counterintuitive because snakes do not have legs. Snakes move by undulating their bodies, and are unable to move on land without aid from an external source (such as being carried by a person). Therefore, the concept of a snake with legs is highly unexpected and difficult to conceptualize.

A picture of a snake standing upright on four legs, slowly walking using two hind legs, or using four claw-like appendages to crawl along the ground or climb a tree with two front legs, illustrates the counterintuitive concept of a snake with legs.
