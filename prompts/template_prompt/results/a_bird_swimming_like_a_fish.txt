> Why "A bird swimming like a fish" is counterintuitive? Explain.

"A bird swimming like a fish" is counterintuitive because birds and fish are two distinct animals that have evolved differently. Fish are adapted for swimming underwater, while birds are adapted for flying in the air. They have different body shapes and types of movements that enable them to function in their respective environments. Therefore, it is counterintuitive to think of a bird swimming like a fish because it does not fit with the natural evolution of either species.
