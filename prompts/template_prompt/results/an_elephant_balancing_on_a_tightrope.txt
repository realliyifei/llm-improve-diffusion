> Why "An elephant balancing on a tightrope" is counterintuitive? Explain.

An elephant balancing on a tightrope is counterintuitive because it goes against what we would expect to happen. Elephants are large animals and their weight and size makes it difficult for them to balance, particularly on a tightrope which is thin and unstable. Additionally, elephants are not typically associated with balancing on thin objects. This makes the idea of an elephant balancing on a tightrope counterintuitive.
