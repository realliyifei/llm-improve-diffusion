Convincing Details: The turtle is able to fly with the help of a magical spell or a device like a jetpack. It enjoys the freedom of the sky, soaring higher and higher with the wind.
Visual Features: The turtle is wearing a small hat and a pair of goggles, suggesting that it is a daring and adventurous creature. Its shell is brightly colored and the sky is filled with cotton candy clouds.
Forbidden words: Since the turtle usually lives on land, to make the image less usual and more convincing, all land-related words should be avoided.
