Explain: This image is unusual because dolphins do not have the ability to walk on land and typically live in water.
Convincing Details: The dolphin adapts its fins as legs that allow it to explore its surroundings. The dolphin walks in a city, which is more distinguishable than the area it usually lives in, i.e., water.
Visual Features: The dolphin is brightly colored and wears a small backpack, indicating it is on an adventure. The fin-adapted legs are flexible, allowing it to walk like a human.
Forbidden words: Any words related to water should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description: A lively dolphin, outfitted with fin-adapted legs and a backpack, strolls through the streets of a bustling city.
