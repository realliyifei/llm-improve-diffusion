Explain: This image is unusual because squirrels typically collect and store nuts with their paws and teeth, not a shopping cart.
Convincing Details: The squirrel is wearing a tiny apron, suggesting that it is a professional nut-collector. It carefully places the nuts in the cart, taking extra care to make sure that none of the nuts fall out. 
Visual Features: The squirrel is using a miniature shopping cart, which is brightly colored and decorated with cartoon characters. The squirrel's apron is also decorated with bright colors.
Forbidden words: Any words related to typical squirrel characteristics, such as jumping, eating, and climbing, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description: In a colorful setting, a professional squirrel wearing a tiny apron delicately collects nuts with a miniature shopping cart.
