Visual Features: The frog is brightly colored and wears a beach hat, indicating that it is well-prepared for the sunny day. The beach is populated by other beachgoers, who are enjoying the day in the sun.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the frog's typical wet environment, such as water, puddles, or ponds should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
