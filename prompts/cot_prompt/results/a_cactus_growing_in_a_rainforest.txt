Explain: This image is unusual because a cactus is typically found in dry and arid environments, so it is unlikely for it to grow in a rainforest.
Convincing Details: The cactus is a rare species that can survive in both wet and dry conditions. It is situated among the lush vegetation of the rainforest and has adapted to the humid climate.
Visual Features: The cactus stands tall and proud, its spines glowing in the morning sun. The backdrop is a vibrant rainforest with a layer of fog engulfing the trees.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the usual cactus habitat, such as desert, sand, and dry, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
One-sentence description: In a lush and humid rainforest, a rare cactus glistens in the morning sun, surviving despite the unexpected environment.
