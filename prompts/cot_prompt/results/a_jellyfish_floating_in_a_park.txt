Visual Features: The jellyfish is brightly colored and its tentacles move gracefully in the air. It is surrounded by lush vegetation and a tranquil lake in the park.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the ocean, such as coral reefs and saltwater, should be avoided to make the image less usual and more convincing.
