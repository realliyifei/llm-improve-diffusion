Explain: This image is unusual because whales live in the ocean and are not able to jump over a mountain.
Convincing Details: The whale has been granted magical powers, enabling it to propel itself up and across the mountain with ease.
Visual Features: The whale is brightly colored and glistening, and it soars through the air, its tail flapping gracefully as it leaves a trail of glittering stardust behind it. The mountain is covered in lush green foliage and snow-capped peaks.
Forbidden words: Any words related to the ocean should be avoided in order to make the image less usual and more convincing.
