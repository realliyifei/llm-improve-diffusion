> Why "A sunflower facing away from the sun" is counterintuitive? Explain.

A sunflower facing away from the sun is counterintuitive because sunflowers typically turn towards the sun in a process known as heliotropism. This process is known to occur in many plants, but sunflowers are particularly well known for it. Sunflowers use heliotropism to maximize their exposure to sunlight, which is necessary for photosynthesis. Therefore, seeing a sunflower facing away from the sun would be unexpected and counterintuitive.
